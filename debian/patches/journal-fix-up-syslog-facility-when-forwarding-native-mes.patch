Subject: journal: fix up syslog facility when forwarding native messages
 (#5667)

Native journal messages (_TRANSPORT=journal) typically don't have a
syslog facility attached to it. As a result when forwarding the messages
to syslog they ended up with facility 0 (LOG_KERN).
Apply syslog_fixup_facility() so we use LOG_USER instead.

Fixes: #5640
(cherry picked from commit b6a20306fa5dbb8129dd09e07efeacfcfc57363f)
