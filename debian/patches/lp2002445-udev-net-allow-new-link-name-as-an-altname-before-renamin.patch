Subject: udev/net: allow new link name as an altname before renaming happens

Origin: upstream, https://github.com/systemd/systemd/commit/d0b31efc1a
Bug-Ubuntu: https://launchpad.net/bugs/2002445

When configuring a link's alternative names, the link's new name to-be
is not allowed to be included because interface renaming will fail if
the new name is already present as an alternative name. However,
rtnl_set_link_name will delete the conflicting alternative name before
renaming the device, if necessary.

Allow the new link name to be set as an alternative name before the
device is renamed. This means that if the rename is later skipped (i.e.
because the link is already up), then the name can at least still be
present as an alternative name.

(modified to apply to v245.5)
