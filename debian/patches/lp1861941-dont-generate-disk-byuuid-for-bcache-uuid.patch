Subject: skip disk/by-uuid for bcache devices

blkid reports bcache superblock dev.uuid as a filesystem UUID but it actually
is not a filesystem, it's the UUID of the backing device, which is maintained
at /dev/bcache/by-uuid instead of /dev/disk/by-uuid.

  [Forwarding Note]

  There is an on-going discussion upstream whether this patch should exist.
  This patch is not a FIX to LP: #1861941, but can work as a mitigation. The
  FIX for LP: #1861941 is the bcache-tools (0003-Add-bcache-export-cached-
  helper.patch).

  Ryan Harper arguments are that blkid - and/or udev default rules - should skip
  devices with "ID_FS_TYPE = bcache" by default from creating symlinks at
  /dev/disk/{by-uuid,by-label}/{ID_FS_UUID_ENC,ID_FS_LABEL_ENC} just because
  those devices aren't meant to be used directly (as they are backing devices
  to bcache). Actually this is what was causing the issue fixed by bcache-tools
  udev rules: symlink management for bcache backing devices were removing
  /dev/bcache/xxx symlinks.

  Considering that this is a minor delta, and I agree to Ryan's arguments, of
  not having /dev/disk/by-uuid/xxx symlinks to devices that should not be
  accessed directly, thus giving a better experience to end user, I'm keeping
  this until either upstream provides it by default OR the patch
  0003-Add-bcache-export-cached-helper.patch can be removed from bcache-tools
  because udev and/or libblkid started differentiating UUID_CACHED and FS_UUID
  when doing /dev/disk/ symlinks.
