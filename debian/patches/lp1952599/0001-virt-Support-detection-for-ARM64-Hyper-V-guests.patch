Subject: virt: Support detection for ARM64 Hyper-V guests

The detection of Microsoft Hyper-V VMs is done by cpuid currently,
however there is no cpuid on ARM64. And since ARM64 is now a supported
architecture for Microsoft Hyper-V guests[1], then use DMI tables to
detect a Hyper-V guest, which is more generic and works for ARM64.
